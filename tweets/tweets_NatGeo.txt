That's all for now! Huge thanks to Ricardo and @DoctorGladys for sharing their knowledge and passion this #WildlifeConservationDay https://t.co/YIk1neFvXj

1334915365915275266
Always be humble and know how to listen, since there are many people who can contribute a lot to projects and our lives. The best of all is to dream and seek to realize those dreams.

1334915365017620480
Study a degree that you really like and try to opt for a master's and a doctorate of science. Reading many scientific articles, you should also learn about the ecology and natural history of the other species that share the habitat and of the forest.

1334915361502846978
Ricardo: If someone wants to work with wildlife and with felines in particular, these would be my advice: first you must have a passion for what you want to do, true wildlife conservation is not easy, but it is not impossible. https://t.co/sGx6JswyOI

1334915355991564288
Also, know that each and every one of us can make a difference ‚Äì even if you start small.

1334915351126093827
@DoctorGladys: Stay focused and Never give up! Conservation work takes dedication, passion and hard work ‚Äì but the rewards, knowing that you are making a difference and protecting wildlife and the environment for future generations - are well worth the effort. https://t.co/RtSUf4v99i

1334915342955655169
QUESTION 6: What advice would you give to someone who wants to do what you do?

1334914349190746119
You have to follow your dreams and my dream is to keep seeing the tracks of the jaguar and hear its roar that gives him away.

1334914347953512458
Ricardo: You can support in different ways, helping as volunteers in field work (at this time with all health security measures), in the dissemination of information about what @yaguarapanama does, and also making donations to continue amplifying the voice of the jaguar.

1334914347072688130
There is a huge potential for positive global change if every one of us just does a little bit. You can also buy products which make a positive conservation difference ‚Äì such as @GCCoffee1, our ‚Äòcoffee with a cause‚Äô, which is available internationally in USA, UK, Kenya and NZ

1334914346053480450
You can also spread awareness about conservation efforts around the world, and give donations which are urgently needed right now to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on endangered species and their habitats.

1334914345168490500
@DoctorGladys: Do whatever you can and give whatever you can manage ‚Äì every little bit makes a difference. And try to make sure your actions make a positive, not a negative, impact on the world ‚Äì reduce plastic use, recycle, avoid wild animal products, reduce red meat consumption

1334914344354803713
QUESTION 5: What's the number one thing an average person can do to help aid conservation efforts like these?

1334913132037369859
All the species that exist in the world contribute to the fact that we humans can minimally breathe and drink water to live. This means that if we continue in a post-pandemic world, we should already be prepared to know what is important, and that is to take care of the planet.

1334913131097812997
Ricardo: I sincerely hope that all humans who live on earth understand how important it is to take care of our house, which is the planet earth, the only house we have. We will continue with the pandemic for a longer time, and I hope there will be a lot of positive reflection.

1334913129994735620
I see local communities also being able to sell their crafts through the internet (for example https://t.co/NLIQSmR52g). Gorilla Conservation Coffee ‚Äòs first distributor in the US also buys crafts from Northern Rangeland Trust in Kenya.

1334913129034231808
People can still support the gorillas by buying a bag of  coffee even if they are not able to visit which has already been happening during the pandemic.

1334913128094715906
We are also finding new ways to support conservation, such as our Gorilla Conservation Coffee which supports livelihoods for community members on the outskirts of Bwindi and a donation from each bag is given back to conservation and community projects #savinggorillasonesipatatime

1334913127058649089
Given people‚Äôs passion for conservation, I could see more people engaging in remote activities such as virtual gorilla tracking, livestreams of night cameras or waterhole monitoring, wildlife documentaries and similar activities as we wait for things to normalize.

1334913126123364354
Conservation efforts will also have to rely on non tourism sources of funding to sustain activities. However, we're thankful that people all over the world are committed to ensuring the protection of our environment and wildlife and are humbled by the donations we've received.

1334913125204766721
This will have ‚Äì and is already having ‚Äì a huge impact on conservation as much of the revenue for conservation comes from tourism. In Uganda, for example, tourism and travel provides about 700,000 jobs and contributes 7.7% of GDP to the Ugandan economy.

1334913124256931847
@DoctorGladys: It may take years for tourism in Uganda and the rest of Africa to resume to pre-COVID-19 levels as many people have been affected by the economic shocks resulting from the pandemic, and people will need time to regain confidence in travel.

1334913123317391362
QUESTION 4: How do you expect conservation efforts to change‚Äîif at all‚Äîin a post-pandemic world?

1334909671623286792
We also reinforced a jaguar (wildlife) and human conflict attention group that works from the calls that people make to Yaguar√° Panama / Ministry of the Environment when there are cases of predation on farms, road kill animals, for example.

1334909670729900033
The positive aspects have been that technology has helped us to be able to give many talks / webinar to many people in Panama and internationally, and to have access to a greater number of people than we think.

1334909669937192963
At this moment I am not sure if there is more or less hunting in the protected areas, it is very difficult to quantify this at the moment.

1334909669027016710
Ricardo: Negative in some aspects and positive in others. Negative because it was impossible to continue the projects and visit the communities due to the total closure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Panama.

1334909668116803585
However, this has resulted in great ape viewing guidelines being upgraded to minimize the risk of disease transmission of not only COVID-19, but other infectious  zoonotic diseases from people to gorillas,  chimpanzees  and orangutans,  as well as other primates

1334909667227656192
We are working hard to train all people who come into contact with, or live in proximity to, the gorillas, particularly habituated gorillas who are no longer naturally wary of humans, on COVID-19 prevention measures.

1334909666309132289
Mountain Gorilla survival is also threatened by the risk of #COVID19 transmission as they are genetically so similar to us. A COVID-19 outbreak amongst the gorillas could have dire consequences for the survival of the species.

1334909665390555140
Poaching and hunting has increased with rising poverty and desperation, particularly around protected areas like Bwindi Impenetrable National Park where much of our work takes place as tourism, on which many people depended for income and jobs completely crashed.

1334909664518148101
@DoctorGladys: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it two major risks for endangered Mountain Gorillas.

1334909663649951746
QUESTION 3: Has the #COVID19 pandemic been positive or negative for the conservation efforts focused on these species?

1334908405484560384
This is followed by loss of habitat; the advance of the livestock and agricultural frontier; misinformation, illegal trafficking, as well as an emerging underground market for the sale of parts for their supposed use in traditional Asian medicine.

1334908404717019139
Ricardo: The main threats to jaguars in Panama are conflict between humans, and for revenge they kill the cats

1334908403878137857
Of particular concern for Mountain Gorillas is the risk of zoonotic diseases transmission as they share over 98% of DNA with humans which makes them susceptible to the same diseases that affect humans.

1334908402951131138
@DoctorGladys: Mountain Gorillas are threatened by habitat loss, disease, poaching and conflict with humans. This is made worse by the living conditions of people surrounding gorilla habitats like poverty, lack of health and other social services and high human population growth

1334908402242359296
Question 2: What are the primary threats to the species in your area of study?

1334907063764480002
Our work deals with changing people's attitudes and perceptions about wild cats through scientific information, use of technology, education and working with local communities to improve the coexistence between human beings and wildlife. I'm in Panama.

1334907062933925888
Ricardo: I'm from the Yaguar√° Panama Foundation and a National Geographic Explorer. We are dedicated to the conservation of the jaguar and the forests where they live, as a key element for the health and survival of thousands of species of plants and animals, including people.

1334907062153850881
@GCCoffee1 is our social enterprise which provides increased incomes to coffee farmers on the outskirts of #Bwindi Impenetrable National Park to improve livelihoods and reduce dependence on natural resources to meet basic needs.
