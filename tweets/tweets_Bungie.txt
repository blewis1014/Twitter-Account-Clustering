@Jojubeee That's a very broad question but as we stated earlier, it takes  us time to gather and verify info. Answers to questions are often not solved immediately but we always strive to get them to you as soon as possible.

@Jojubeee What's your question? We're not trying to dodge anything.

1319412782886907906
@Jojubeee It is for us. We, the community team, need to work on gathering and verifying the info internally before sharing. Often the answers are much more complicated than yes or no.
