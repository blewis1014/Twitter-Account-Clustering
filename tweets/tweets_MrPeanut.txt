Planters Power Snacking Move: #17429

When trying to catch a snack you’ve tossed in the air, try to align it with your nose. Just before the snack makes contact, tilt your head back to line up your mouth and stick the landing.

1317212640750432256
It’s been brought to my attention that instead of taking all the candy OUT of the trail mix, some of you are adding more IN. 

This is a #PowerSnackingMove and I respect it. 

That is all.
