was finally proven to be BIGGER than the hate they tried to keep us down with. That’s all 💞 also feeling so thoughtful today so I’m rambling 😂

1325175768591130625
Also I wrote that tweet after  watching a video a friend sent me of the streets celebrating in West Hollywood today, I broke down in tears of gratitude. I wanted to share that with you because the love I saw my queer community sharing between one another...

1325172210240155650
Also - stop worrying what I tweet, BIDEN WON YALL 🥳🥳🥳😂😂😂

1325171890655166466
FYI - I’m also not pretending to have never acted bigger than anyone. Most of us have chosen sides during the past several years and added to the conversation - AS WE SHOULD HAVE - memes and all - But I personally am just tired of living in a divided country

1325169609411059712
Remember when we didn’t all think the same? (It’s still happening) Opinions differ - I wasn’t “commanding” anyone to do anything. Now go out and celebrate or meme IF YOU PLEASE - DO YOU - all I’m saying is hatred DIDN’T work for the last administration ✌🏼

1325168174002630663
Look, y’all do what you want. I don’t normally tweet because it pisses someone off but I stopped caring a long time ago. Just trying to spread love and light today... after all that is what we fought for right?

1325141667960283136
Today isn’t about celebrating in the face of those that oppose your views and values, but celebrating from a place of LOVE - combating the hate that has encompassed and oppressed so many of us the past four years. Let the healing begin. 🙏🏼
