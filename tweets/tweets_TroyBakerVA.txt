@pattonoswalt Somewhere in a dark alley, two strangers meet. They speak in clandestine tones.

Stranger 1: “You holding?”

Stranger 2: “Yeah.”

Stranger 1: “Lemme see.”

Stranger 2: (holds him)

Stranger 1: “That’s some good shit.”

Shooting this was one of my favourite days on set. To me, it represents Joel &amp; Ellie finding the respite the “campfire laughing” concept art promised. In this scene Ellie &amp; Ashley simultaneously &amp; beautifully exist.
Neil crafted a remarkable moment @Naughty_Dog brought it to life https://t.co/wQ2twXyfc2

It’s proven very easy to list all the “bad”things that happened this year. Together, let’s make a different list of all the good things. 
What was your silver lining?
What was that ray of hope?
What was that one moment you felt it was going to be alright?

Yeah #MassEffect is great but have you ever elected a new president effectively overthrowing tyranny and beginning the path to healing a nation divided by systemic racism and political division?

I am genuinely moved by this. Buried as deeply inside us as the history of our transgressions is our ability to overcome them. I did not vote for John McCain but I did respect him. This speech and how it can continues to inspire, even after this death, stands as evidence why. https://t.co/lejJgyX8jY

@IdealVoiceovers Rest.

Liquids.

Cough don’t clear. 

Vocal warmups in the morning become more necessary than before.

Inhale peppermint and eucalyptus oil.

Flush with a saline nasal rinse to clear out any residual congestion. 

Be patient. It takes time to heal.

He *almost* does this. But instead he focuses on the problem with roadsigns rather the perils of potholes.

1321480447323303942
Is what both reveals and causes the rejection of these principles. This philosophy is not about avoiding potholes but instead accepting them should they find their way into our path, learning what we can from them and then sharing that with others as best we can.

1321480446367002626
I think it’s more likely he found some quotes and some forums. Went down a Youtube rabbit hole and maybe read a book. I don’t see someone who has dutifully studied the writings of Seneca, Marcus or even contemporary apologists of Stoicism. It’s this deficiency that I believe...

1321480445414891520
Marcus had been studying this for almost sixty years. It wasn’t until he was well into his 40’s and 50’s that he begin to write about it. That’s why the history of this IS important. It encourages patience and promotes perspective. It’s about diligence, not results.

1321480444391481344
Stoicism is not the presentation of virtue but rather the pursuit of it. Unfortunately this outlook is part of the problem. It seeks to shortcut and quick fix. He states that he had been studying this for 6 months when he first encountered the problem with Stoicism.

1321480443523256321
He is explicitly states that he doesn’t care about how or why this philosophy was developed, he simply wants to know how he can use it. That mindset precludes that stoicism posits; which is to constantly improve on an idea.

1321480441497444360
So much to unpack here. After viewing it I feel this guy mixed up sugar, butter, flour and egg, got sick and is now telling people what’s wrong with eating cake. If you don’t understand why principles were developed, how then can they be appropriately applied to life? https://t.co/dGAowumPwT
