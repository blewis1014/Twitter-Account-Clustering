@kevinlove @ddlovato i’m jealous of you haha. while I’ve been able to have more time to work on my music, i haven’t been putting in the work for self reflection. I need to take my own advice and follow your path to better improve myself 💙

1308128634801070081
@kevinlove @ddlovato congrats! it’s inspirational seeing all the people who are finding productive things to do in quarantine. love seeing all my friends and family learning new things or getting into healthier living. no better time than right now!

1308128126677864448
@ddlovato @kevinlove Couldn’t agree more @ddlovato! Each day presents us a new opportunity, it’s up to us to decide how we use it. 💙

1308126720990433281
@kevinlove @ddlovato i’ve been using this time to dive head first into music. i’ve written more music now than ever before. now I don’t know how good the music is… but there is a lot of it 🙂

1308125628625874944
@kevinlove @ddlovato i focus on the things I can control and not worry about the things i can’t control. i wake up each day trying to build good days on top of good days. looking at the big picture is too overwhelming, we have to just chip away at being happier every day.

1308125303974146048
@kevinlove @ddlovato i can imagine. us musicians usually have a studio at home, but athletes don’t have that same level of facility that the teams have.

1308124221864685568
@kevinlove @ddlovato i don’t know how people with kids are doing it. they’re the real heroes. i have a hard enough time trying to make a grilled cheese sandwich at the same time as a zoom call. parents deserve to be applauded during this.

1308123125364658177
@kevinlove @ddlovato i hear you Den. i’ve been doing a lot of gaming. as a competitive person, video games have given me an outlet to physically relax while letting my mind continue to run. It might not be considered “productive” but it’s been my outlet.

1308121769694261249
@kevinlove @ddlovato what helps your mind wander? music? working out? find something that you can fully dive into so your mind doesn't focus on the negatives. It’s important we have these outlets so our mind can “turn off” for awhile.

@kevinlove @ddlovato being in quarantine has given us a lot of alone time. it’s up to us to use it how we want. focusing on the negatives isn’t going to get us anywhere. i like to pick one goal a day to attack. then when the week is over I can look back and list all my accomplishments.

Stay safe, wear your mask, wash your hands, and practice social distancing. The sooner we can do all that, the sooner we can go back to life as we once knew it. ❤️

It’s so important for us to be there for one another during these testing times so I want all of you to know that I can’t wait to see you all soon.

1288488824545239041
I also know a lot of us have been hit hard financially on top of everything else so I wanted to make sure everyone that bought a ticket got their money back. All tickets will be fully refunded at the point of purchase.

1288488823622574081
The safety and well-being of every single one of you is way important to me than the thought of rescheduling the tour for 2021.

1288488822683049984
I’ve decided to cancel my tour. Up until a few months ago, pandemics were just something I thought existed in movies and the history books that we all read in school, little did any of us ever imagine we’d be living through one as I type this.
