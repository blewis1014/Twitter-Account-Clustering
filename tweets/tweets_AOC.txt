The whole point of protesting is to make ppl uncomfortable.

Activists take that discomfort w/ the status quo &amp; advocate for concrete policy changes. Popular support often starts small &amp; grows.

To folks who complain protest demands make others uncomfortable... that’s the point.

1334182970337464321
The thing that critics of activists don’t get is that they tried playing the “polite language” policy game and all it did was make them easier to ignore.

It wasn’t until they made folks uncomfortable that there was traction to do ANYTHING even if it wasn’t their full demands.

1334181687811600384
What if activists aren’t PR firms for politicians &amp; their demands are bc police budgets are exploding, community resources are shrinking to bankroll it, &amp; ppl brought this up for ages but it wasn’t until they said “defund” that comfortable people started paying attn to brutality

1329541684598812674
Republicans are mad at this when they literally just voted to do just this in March.

The reason they’re opposed to it now is because last time they got a Wall Street bailout and this time all that’s left is helping working people, the disabled, the poor, etc.
