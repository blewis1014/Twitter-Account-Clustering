The whole point of protesting is to make ppl uncomfortable.

Activists take that discomfort w/ the status quo &amp; advocate for concrete policy changes. Popular support often starts small &amp; grows.

To folks who complain protest demands make others uncomfortable... that‚Äôs the point.

1334182970337464321
The thing that critics of activists don‚Äôt get is that they tried playing the ‚Äúpolite language‚Äù policy game and all it did was make them easier to ignore.

It wasn‚Äôt until they made folks uncomfortable that there was traction to do ANYTHING even if it wasn‚Äôt their full demands.
