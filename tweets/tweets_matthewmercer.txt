Don‚Äôt forget to love each other. Especially in times as challenging as these. &lt;3

1334798560152305665
I‚Äôm ok, and handling my own anxieties with the growing attention in the best ways I can, but this is more about me trying to say my peace on the subject. I grew up in fandom. I adore fandom, and love helping ours flourish. I‚Äôve see it doing amazing things. This is just a blemish.

1334798559502192640
To follow up, I am very aware that (thankfully) such scenarios are very much in the minority. Every fandom has its toxic elements, and those sometimes can be the LOUDEST by far, skewing perception. Even so, we see the overwhelming good, and that (+my friends) keeps me going. &lt;3

1334789337368592384
Scenarios like this continue to push me away from engaging online, for my own mental health. I don‚Äôt want to pull away, but man... sometimes you all try my patience. The conspiracies, the assumptions, the untrue, unwarranted statements... *sigh*

1334789336470962177
Sometimes the mental gymnastics I read when some folks try to justify a perceived, personal slight by creators and storytellers who both made no promises to you, or did nothing but continue to follow an organic, honest path with care, makes me not want to create.

1334789335724388352
However, the misinterpretation of a story (especially improvised) wielded as a weapon against others who disagree with your ship, or anger against not seeing YOUR ship realized and turning it into hate for a fandom and/or it‚Äôs creators is toxic beyond belief.

1334789334877097984
I‚Äôm seeing some really toxic discussions, based in (surprise) shipping spaces. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm all for shipping. I think, when engaged with in a HEALTHY way, can be a great way to enjoy media and engage with it.

I apologize to anyone who was hurt by this unfortunate miscommunication and misstep. I know none of this was done in malice, but even so, I am sorry. 

@Darker_Hue and the many people who worked on Haunted West are good people, and I hope you do still check out the game &amp; stream.

Having hearts in the right place doesn‚Äôt absolve the fact that some stories (especially historical leaning) should be told by people who come from such cultures and history, not be told by folks of privilege.  Especially in entertainment.

I avoid emails on weekends (therapists orders), so didn‚Äôt see my character‚Äôs sheet and ethnicity until today, when I saw the discourse in my mentions. I agree with the same issues many of folks expressed, so I spoke with Chris and mentioned I had to exit from the stream.

1325930057798279170
I was eager and happy to help @Darker_Hue and the wonderful cast with their Haunted West RPG stream with a cameo when Chris requested, leaving the character‚Äôs creation in Chris‚Äô hands. Even the best of intentions can miss unseen problems.

Knowing this broken system, working within it was necessary at the time because it‚Äôs currently stacked against radical change. With this, I hope, we can begin the work to push things towards a better way. It will take time, but I have hope. Today was a step, a good one. /rant

‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äù have not fixed the problem with this, just changed the direction into one with a little more hope. No political party is free of guilt or issues, and we NEED more than two parties as we go. This binary (like many binaries) is unnecessary and flawed.

1325165671332765697
This system is flawed, our politics are corrupt across the board, and our country is fundamentally in need of some proactive social healing and reeducation... I have no illusions that THIS changes everything. It‚Äôs just a step away from the precipice. I‚Äôll take a small victory.
