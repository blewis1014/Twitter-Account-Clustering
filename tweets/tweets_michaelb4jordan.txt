Change is hard, and no one can do it alone. Just know I’m right here with you.

Let’s make moves:

☑️ Read: https://t.co/6gom0hZ4az

☑️ Tell us: what resources do you need to #ChangeHollywood?

☑️ Take action: what commitments can you drive to #ChangeHollywood?

1286424124349284352
#ChangeHollywood is an initiative @ColorOfChange. The collab we launched today — creatives on the inside, advocates on the outside — illuminates a roadmap to change. 

And we'll build resources to help it happen. Just reach out w/ what you need or want to do #ChangeHollywood https://t.co/STndfaRZMJ

1286423731615793161
Power moves only. Answer the calls with commitments to #ChangeHollywood:

1. Divest from Police
2. Invest in Anti-Racist Content 
3. Invest in Black Talent &amp; Careers 
4. Invest in Black Communities

And to US✊🏾: Commitments are coming. Keep the faith. Keep organizing. https://t.co/wU8YxuZgaF

We are all accomplices in this fight to transform Hollywood.

Hollywood has a history of racism … Excluding Black talent, silencing Black voices, derailing Black careers, and propping up policing and injustices…
