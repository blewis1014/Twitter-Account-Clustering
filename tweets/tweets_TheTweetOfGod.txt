Then one fine Election Eve, Borat came to say,
‚ÄúRudolph with your wang so small, 
You‚Äôre the biggest dick of all!‚Äù

Then all the Trump aides ditched him,
And they shouted out with glee,
‚ÄúRudolph, the Red-Faced Horndog,
You‚Äôll go down in infamy!‚Äù

Rudolph the Red-Faced Horndog
Had a very tiny wang.
And if you ever saw it
You would barely see it hang.
All of the other Trump aides
Knew he was a drunken sham.
They knew that not-poor Rudolph
Gained from every Russian scam.

How can the Pope come out in support of same-sex unions when in the Bible Jesus specifically says absolutely nothing against it?!?
