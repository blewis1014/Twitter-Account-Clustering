A guy in Illinois apparently still has a half-eaten sandwich left by Richard Nixon 60 years ago. Nixon had his faults, but I do like the idea of a president who is capable of half-eating anything.

@Kelly_Wri He asked for 1.  She gave him 3. Why 3 is not certain but could be related to a great story  from Tolkien‚Äôs earlier drafts of the Silmarillion (that may not be canon) involving F√´anor, Galadriel,  the Two Trees, and her hair. That should be enough clues to go find it. Good luck!
