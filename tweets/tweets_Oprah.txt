Two months ago, I invited you to take a walk with @oprahsbookclub through “Hidden Valley Road” by @bobkolker. It told the story of the Galvins, a family of 12 kids, six whom developed schizophrenia at a time where no one knew how to treat it—&amp; somehow still remained a family. https://t.co/lUtxUuDV6T

#DavidOyelowo pointed out that Emmett Till’s death was the precursor to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the ask was about segregation.

We’re going through a reckoning right now &amp; it’s not only about police violence against Black people, but the systemic racism that’s rooted in the soul of our country.
