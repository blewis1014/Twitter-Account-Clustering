@from7to10 @ShaineScalph Well what is your goal, though? News has become narrative today- on both sides.

Is your goal to distract from the fact that trump has been our worst president?

1325149266436911105
@MatthewHaley11 And that‚Äôs a strength- to admit when you didn‚Äôt do something perfectly...and it‚Äôs something Trump has never done. At the expense of you and I as Americans.

1325149055928791042
@MatthewHaley11 Trump was shown,by bipartisan fact checkers,to lie every single time he spoke publicly. Did you call him out? Get on his case when he bullied, mocked, or billboarded false issues so badly that Twitter had to flag it? Or do you just try and fact check people who speak against him?

1325141655356272640
@MatthewHaley11 It was not focused on black people. That‚Äôs been proven time and time again. It was focused on criminals. It was mutated by the cities that implemented it. It‚Äôs been studied for years.

1325141305463246848
@MatthewHaley11 You‚Äôve got it backwards. Trump didn‚Äôt block everyone from entering America. He blocked Chinese nationals - and even then, late. And it wasn‚Äôt a great number of folks denied entry. That‚Äôs what he does to border immigrants. McConnell blocked the stimulus bill. It‚Äôs. In. The. News

1325140673138479105
Yeah, sex is great- but have you ever had a @sprinkles while watching @JoeBiden win the presidency?

1325139611253956610
@MatthewHaley11 Oh, man...You‚Äôre down a rabbit hole. Corona isn‚Äôt trump‚Äôs fault. His RESPONSE and ACTIONS after corona: are. 

Biden wasn‚Äôt president for 47 years. He was one of many senators. You need to educate yourself on Biden‚Äôs track record. That‚Äôs not a snarky comment. I‚Äôm serious.

Before you engage in a political discussion with me- consider the following:

1) did you vote?
2) do you have multiple sources of legitimate news for your point? (Read: legitimate)
3) do you understand that no candidate is perfect?
4.) do you know change doesn‚Äôt happen overnight?

1325138358826393601
@MatthewHaley11 I think you‚Äôre confusing perfect president with Biden winning. There is no perfect president, candidate, senator, or human. I‚Äôm not. You‚Äôre not. But there is a difference between a corrupt, self serving IMPEACHED president and 48 years as a public servant senator turned president

@djjoeyoatb @cwild22 The virus isn‚Äôt his fault. His response to it- was. Ignoring scientists, lying about how dangerous it is (he‚Äôs on tape), and ignoring rising cases and deaths- he says it‚Äôs ‚Äúover‚Äù. Man, I work on a lot of wild projects that require massive imagination. I can‚Äôt follow on this one.

@djjoeyoatb @cwild22 One time- there was a radical idea that we should have a multi-failed business man turned reality tv star with no government experience be president. And that led to corruption, collusion, and conspiracy theories. You‚Äôre not open to any other opinion but your own. Good luck 2 u.
