@MarcusHouseGame @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs.

@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so it‚Äôs mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year

1328769437433016322
@speculawyer @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Exactly

1328767073506430977
@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do. 

What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.

@parstalberg @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!

@josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesn‚Äôt matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.

@ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Pretty close. Definitely feel üíØ if I take DayQuil. Frankly, this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences I‚Äôve ever had.

@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* don‚Äôt blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.

1328737951786934272
@pcgamer We should just count the atoms at this point

1328734675544707072
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it‚Äôs less than 1% of the pain.

1328732220530581504
@Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didn‚Äôt work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.
