Show people you care. Put effort. People just give up when they see it takes effort because they think they’re entitled to any sort of compensation. You’re not, man. But if people see you actually care and believe in it, they will gravitate when they find you.

1336179548761669633
People ask me for tips etc but there’s literally no secret to growing/building a community.
