1334322904763420672
Of course, some of these ‚Äò-ic‚Äô words are used commonly as both adjectives and nouns:

ACADEMIC
ALCOHOLIC
ARCTIC
DIABETIC
ELASTIC
EPIC
MYSTIC
TONIC

1334253231573176322
Other words that use the Greek root ‚Äòpan-‚Äò include:

PANACEA (originally) ‚Äúremedy for all‚Äù
PANDEMONIUM (originally) ‚Äúall the demons‚Äù
PANTHEON (originally) ‚Äúall the gods‚Äù
PANORAMA (originally) ‚Äúability to see all‚Äù

1334250846129967112
This general meaning was then frequently medical, as in ‚Äúpandemic disease‚Äù or ‚Äúpandemic fever.‚Äù 

By the 1800s, this use had become so widespread that PANDEMIC had become a noun that could stand on its own, meaning ‚Äúa disease on all the people.‚Äù

https://t.co/OdlPl12luz

1334250369610866691
The original use of PANDEMIC in English in the 1600s was as an adjective meaning ‚Äúwidespread, universal.‚Äù It even had the meanings ‚Äúvulgar, common‚Äù in our 1934 Unabridged edition. https://t.co/iruje2oL5C

1334250139540709376
PANDEMIC is from the Greek word ‚Äòpandƒìmos‚Äô ‚Äúof or belonging to all the people,‚Äù from ‚Äòpan-‚Äò (‚Äúall‚Äù) + ‚Äòdƒìmos‚Äô (‚Äúpopulace‚Äù). 

‚ÄòDƒìmos‚Äô is also the root of DEMOCRACY and DEMAGOGUE.

1334249783138136068
The English ‚Äò-ic‚Äô corresponds to the French suffix ‚Äò-ique‚Äô and the Latin suffix ‚Äò-icus.‚Äô

So, for example: 

we have the English ‚Äòscholastic‚Äô 
from the French ‚Äòscholastique‚Äô 
from the Latin ‚Äòscholasticus‚Äô

1334249533673512962
Some such words we only know as nouns, but if you dig back far enough, their roots are adjectival:

MUSIC (originally) ‚Äúof the muses‚Äù
MAGIC (originally) ‚Äúof the magus (magician)‚Äù 
LYRIC (originally) ‚Äúof a lyre‚Äù
TOPIC (originally) ‚Äúof a place (topos)‚Äù

1334249281465757702
Let‚Äôs look at the word PANDEMIC itself.

The suffix ‚Äò-ic‚Äô in English is an adjective suffix:

ANGELIC: having the qualities of an angel
CUBIC: having the characteristics of a cube
PROBLEMATIC: posing a problem

https://t.co/EHodymYVRh
